How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
What did I :
Do ; I used diff -u to find the difference between two files .Pretty sleek 
Notice : Some funny page numbers and + and - signs 
Feel : Its an amazing experience 
I will try this on my notes , in the future I have a tool to compare notes
