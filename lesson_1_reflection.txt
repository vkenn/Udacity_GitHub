How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
What did I :
Do ; I used diff -u to find the difference between two files .Pretty sleek 
Notice : Some funny page numbers and + and - signs 
Feel : Its an amazing experience 
I will try this on my notes , in the future I have a tool to compare notes

It helps me spot bugs and restore file versions to a period with no errors

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
One may forget to commit .The other is making too small commits or larger ones .
AUtonomy is one pro , you decide what a logical change is

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git was created with a software engineer in mind

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log --stat to see how big of changes were made 
git diff commit_1 commit_2 to find the difference between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I know I can always revert to previous
